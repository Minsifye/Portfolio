### Machine Learning Portfolio Projects 


#### [Identifying_Suspicious_Activities_In_Financial_Data.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Minsifye/Portfolio/blob/master/Identifying_Suspicious_Activities_In_Financial_Data.ipynb) - 
This Jupyter Notebook is used to showcase, how suspicious activities can be caught using a supervised learning algorithm in existing customer data under the compliance department of a bank or financial institution. The results show that False Positives can be reduced using Supervised Machine Learning algorithms because these algorithms have the potential to differentiate between regular and suspicious patterns of customer activity. This project is created under ITCS 6156 - Machine Learning at UNC Charlotte.


#### [Finding_Donor_CharityML.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Minsifye/Projects/blob/master/Finding_Donors_CharityML.ipynb) - 
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization that provides financial support for people learning machine learning. In an effort to improve donor outreach effectiveness, I have built an algorithm that best identifies potential donors. My goal was to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield.

#### [Image_Classifier_Model](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Minsifye/Portfolio/blob/master/ImageClassifier/Image%20Classifier%20Project.ipynb) - 
In this project, I have implemented an image classification application using a deep learning model on a dataset of images. First I have trained the model to classify new images using Jupyter notebook and then converted it into a Python application that will run from the command line in a system. A Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project-Term1.


#### [Identify_Customer_Segments](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Minsifye/Portfolio/blob/master/Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb) - 
The data and design for this project were provided by Arvato Financial Services. I have applied unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households. I have preprocessed the data, applied dimensionality reduction techniques, and implemented clustering algorithms to segment customers with the goal of optimizing customer outreach for a mail-order company. A Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project-Term1.


#### [Bank_Churn_Model.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Minsifye/Projects/blob/master/Bank_Churn_Model.ipynb) - 
Bank Churning Model is built to predict possibility of a customer to leave the bank, this dataset is fictional and taken from https://www.superdatascience.com/machine-learning/ platform.


#### [HousingData_LinearRegression.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Minsifye/Projects/blob/master/HousingData_LinearRegression.ipynb) -
This project is one of the first project, I started working with. In this project, I am using Linear Regression model to predict house prices for king county, this dataset is taken from Kaggle platform.

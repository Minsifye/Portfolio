### Machine Learning Projects 


#### [Finding_Donor_CharityML.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Minsifye/Projects/blob/master/Finding_Donors_CharityML.ipynb) - 
Used Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms to find possible donors based on their features specified in the dataset. A Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project-Term1.



#### [HousingData_LinearRegression.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Minsifye/Projects/blob/master/HousingData_LinearRegression.ipynb) -
Linear Regression model to predict house prices for king county, this dataset is taken from Kaggle platform.



#### [Bank_Churn_Model.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Minsifye/Projects/blob/master/Bank_Churn_Model.ipynb) - 
Bank Churning Model to predict possibility of a customer to leave the bank, this dataset is fictional and taken from https://www.superdatascience.com/machine-learning/ platform.



#### [Image_Classifier_Model](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Minsifye/Portfolio/blob/master/ImageClassifier/Image%20Classifier%20Project.ipynb) - 
In this project, I have implemented an image classification application using a deep learning model on a
dataset of images. First I have trained the model to classify new images using Jupyter notebook and then converted it into a Python application that will run from the command line in a system. A Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project-Term1.

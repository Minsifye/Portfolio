### Machine Learning Projects 


#### [Finding_Donor_CharityML.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Minsifye/Projects/blob/master/Finding_Donors_CharityML.ipynb) - 
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization that provides financial support for people learning machine learning. In an effort to improve donor outreach effectiveness, I have built an algorithm that best identifies potential donors. My goal was to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield. A Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project-Term1.



#### [Image_Classifier_Model](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Minsifye/Portfolio/blob/master/ImageClassifier/Image%20Classifier%20Project.ipynb) - 
In this project, I have implemented an image classification application using a deep learning model on a dataset of images. First I have trained the model to classify new images using Jupyter notebook and then converted it into a Python application that will run from the command line in a system. A Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project-Term1.


#### [Identify_Customer_Segments](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Minsifye/Portfolio/blob/master/Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb) - 
The data and design for this project was provided by Arvato Financial Services. I have applied unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households. I have preprocessed the data, applied dimensionality reduction techniques, and implemented clustering algorithms to segment customers with the goal of optimizing customer outreach for a mail order company. A Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project-Term1.


#### [Bank_Churn_Model.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Minsifye/Projects/blob/master/Bank_Churn_Model.ipynb) - 
Bank Churning Model is built to predict possibility of a customer to leave the bank, this dataset is fictional and taken from https://www.superdatascience.com/machine-learning/ platform.


#### [HousingData_LinearRegression.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Minsifye/Projects/blob/master/HousingData_LinearRegression.ipynb) -
This project is one of the first project, I started working with. In this project, I am using Linear Regression model to predict house prices for king county, this dataset is taken from Kaggle platform.
